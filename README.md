# Customer Churn - Engineering

The main purpose of this project, is to focus on the engineering 
part and not so on the modelling part. We will create efficient data pipelines and
will adhere to coding best practices using different tools, languages, and technologies like
Python, Scala, Spark, Docker, CI/CD tools, etc.

Note: This repo will be used for testing different technologies.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you need to clone this repo and run the docker/docker-shell.sh script.
```shell

```
or run
```shell
bash docker/docker-shell.sh
```

### Prerequisites

Docker must be installed in order to run the project with Docker. Otherwise, it can be ran
by running the python scripts (train.py/predict.py) individually.
