# Customer Churn - Engineering

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SteliosGian/churn-engineering.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SteliosGian/churn-engineering)

The main purpose of this project, is to focus on the engineering 
part and not so on the modelling part. We will create efficient data pipelines and
will adhere to coding best practices using different tools, languages, and technologies like
Python, Scala, Spark, Docker, CI/CD tools, etc.

Note: This repo will be used for testing different technologies.
